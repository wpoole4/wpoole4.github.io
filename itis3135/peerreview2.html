                <li>CRAP Principles</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: Good contrast here, stays consistent throughout the webpages and the text fits well with the background. No need to change the color scheme.</li>
                    <li>Repitition: The website stays consistent throughout, each webpage has the same font. Good consistency.</li>
                    <li>Allignment: Mostly good, the allignment in the "About Us" page is a little strange, but looks good on the Home and Gallery page.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: Everything is spaced well except the footer needs to be worked on. Otherwise, mostly looking good.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>File names seem to be proper and folder/file locations are correct.</li>
                <li>Biggest thing I noticed was the Footer. It doesn't seem alligned correctly and could use some coloring/proper formatting.</li>
                <li>The booking page seems unfinished, if it's made into a form similar to the form activity we did a few months ago for instance, it'd work well</li>
                <li>The "About Us" page could be alligned differently and have more information, perhaps. For example, put a picture of the person on top and the info about them below the picture.</li>
                <li>The home page, services page, and gallery page look great. Just fix the footer and touch up the "booking" and "about us" page and it'll see great improvement.</li>
