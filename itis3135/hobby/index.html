            <p>This hobby page is about voice over. I hope this website can provide some interesting and useful info! Voice Over can classify as commercial, audiobook readings, radio, character acting, and more! I personally find interest in commercial readings and character acting.

            <p>While I have many hobbies, voice over is probably my most "artsy" one, I suppose. It's something that seems very simple but has a lot more layers than people give it credit for. If you'd like to know more info, be sure to check out the other sections!</p>

            <h2>About Voice Over</h2>
            <p>Voice Over is a hobby I've had since I was 16 years old. I started by auditioning for small projects online for small video games and small projects. While most of my experience currently is in character acting, since that's the fun stuff, I've wanted to look into other types of voice over, which I plan to do very soon. Commercial voice over is of interest to me since that's where a lot of money is in the industry.
                 While computer science is my career, voice over is my passion. I've started taking classes for voice over this year and plan to take a few more to prepare myself for potentially doing more professional voice over projects to make a money off of my passion. </p>

                 <p>As stated on the home page, voice over is a lot more complex than people make it out to be. When doing performative voice-over, you have to worry about breath control, enunciation, emotive speaking, even your body movements, believe it or not. On top of this, there will be directors that will tell you how to deliver your lines and engineers that will modulate your voice to sound professional-grade.
                     There's also the concern for good equipment, such as good mic, an interface, a software program to capture your voice, and a solid voice-over booth. Probably the hardest part of voice over is actually finding and landing professional jobs or gigs, since the industry is incredibly competitive and auditions can be exhausting. Overall, there's a lot of things that go into voice over, if you'd like more info, be sure to check out the other sections!

            <h2>When I Started and How I Improved</h2>
            <p>I started voice-over back in 2018. Here's a table to show how I've improved every single year since then, documenting what I did each year to improve my skills.</p>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Year</th>
                    <th>How I Improved</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2018</td>
                    <td>The year I started. I bought a mic and a phantom power source, started auditioning for very small projects online.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2019</td>
                    <td>I started auditioning for even more stuff, I also bought a new microphone and interface which is still what I use today.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2020</td>
                    <td>This year was kinda slow because of the pandemic, but I was still doing many projects and I booked my largest project in this year (still wasn't a massive project, but was a Youtube series that had millions of views).</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2021</td>
                    <td>I started social media highlighting my voiceover capabilities, it surprisngly took off and I gained thousands and thousands of followers for it. I had some professional voice over artists even follow me! Getting your name out there is an important step.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2022</td>
                    <td>So far, I've been taking voice over classes and I've been posting on my VO social media to get more followers.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>An important factor about voice over is to take your time and do things at your own pace. I've personally been doing it as a hobby for years, although I've considered going into it more professionally this year, my start is taking classes!</p>
