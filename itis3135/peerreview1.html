                <li>CRAP Principles</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: The colors are decent, although I think the black + dark brown can be difficult to see. Instead of black, maybe try a lighter color. Otherwise, good colors</li>
                    <li>Repitition: The website is consistent throughout. Everything is easily recognizable and the theme of the website remains the same throughout the pages.</li>
                    <li>Alignment: Work on this a little bit, I think the pictures are either too big or need to be at the bottom (e.g Home page/Contact Page). Perhaps try moving the box sections at the top rather than the bottom (e.g "Boxed paragraph section" at the top instead of bottom?) </li>
                    <li>Proximity: Some things are little close to each other, but mostly good. Try spacing some of the sections by rearranging or resizing.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Files are managed properly, all lowercase file names and everything is in proper folders/file names</li>
                <li>Gallery does not seem to work properly, the buttons work but the images are not popping up, at least from where I looked.</li>
                <li>Donate/Learn More is not done, just add content and it'll be good!</li>
                <li>Definitely needs some work but great start. Just rearrange some things, change some coloring, fix the gallery/finish the donate page, and it'll be looking good!</li>
            </ol>
