        <h3><a href = "https://www.vogue.com/?us_site=y">VOGUE</a></h3>
        <p>
            <ul>CRAP Principles: 
                <li>Contrast: VOGUE primarily just uses black and white for contrast, which fits for their brand. This is consistent within all their pages on theri website and black/white contrast, while simple, can be effective for many brands. VOGUE also uses a sharp and eye-catching font.</li>
                <li>Repetition: As you browse their website, each section and webpage have a very similar structure which keeps a good consistency for the person browsing.</li>
                <li>Allignment: VOGUE aligns their text and images consistently. Their Logo is at the top-center, their images align equally throughout their pages, and text is minimal but when it is their it's placed marginially correct.</li>
                <li>Proximity: Everything on VOGUE's webpage is spaced out reasonably and in such a way that's pleasing for the viewer. Nothing feels too cluttered or overly-spaced out. VOGUE takes advantage of horizontal lines to space things out and images/text is spaced as they should be.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3><a href = "https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale, School of Art</a></h3>
        <p>
            <ul>CRAP Principles: 
                <li>Contrast: Yale Schoo of Art is a prime example of how to not do a website. Starting with Contrast, there are a whole batch of colors that don't fit together and the image in the background makes the website hard to look at. They also use gradients, which is usually a big no-no in graphic and website design.</li>
                <li>Repetition: There is very little consistency on this website. Some webpages are formatted similarly, but each webpage has elements that are placed all over and everything is messy. They also change fonts on different elements that are basic and don't stand out</li>
                <li>Allignment: While the website is overall usually aligned left or centered, the text is placed in inconsistent spots and images are a variety of sizes and aren't shaped properly. Overall, there is no consistent or effective allignment of text or images.</li>
                <li>Proximity: While the vertical spacing isn't too horrible, the horizontal spacing is way too close together. Nothing is spaced conveniently and text spaces are placed all over the place.</li>
